### INPUT/PROMPT
The following prompt was executed recursively using the `AT3` prompt strategy (one sub-task at a time) and targeted the `GPT-4o` model.

```
GENERATION REQUEST > 
#ROLE :: Evaluator
#CONTEXT :: The project is focused on creating a GitHub Pages site using React, targeted at personas including CIO, VP of Engineering, Engineering Manager, Principal Architect, DevOps Engineer, and Cloud Ops Engineer. The value proposition (content for the site) centers on reducing the need for experienced engineering talent. The customer has already purchased the domain from AWS (Route 53) and requires it to be mapped to the GitHub Pages site. Break down the project into major tasks like development, setup, deployment, and connecting, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. Assume that all necessary tools and accounts are already available.
#CUSTOMER REQUEST :: Develop a static site using React, structured around key personas in the tech industry. Set up the GitHub repository for GitHub Pages, ensuring it's ready for web hosting. Deploy the site, ensuring all React components and static assets are properly configured for GitHub Pages. Connect the custom domain purchased from AWS Route 53 to the GitHub Pages site, including DNS configuration and verification of domain ownership. Return all instructions in Markdown as a single response users can follow step-by-step.
