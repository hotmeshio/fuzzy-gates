# One Shot Prompt (ChatGPT-4o)
[Compare to AT3 Prompt (ChatGPT-4o)](./readme_ghpages_at3.md)

## INPUT/PROMPT
- `context` The project is focused on creating a GitHub Pages site using React, targeted at personas including CIO, VP of Engineering, Engineering Manager, Principal Architect, DevOps Engineer, and Cloud Ops Engineer. The value proposition (content for the site) centers on reducing the need for experienced engineering talent. The customer has already purchased the domain from AWS (Route 53) and requires it to be mapped to the GitHub Pages site. Break down the project into major tasks like development, setup, deployment, and connecting, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. Assume that all necessary tools and accounts are already available.
- `instructions` Develop a static site using React, structured around key personas in the tech industry. Set up the GitHub repository for GitHub Pages, ensuring it's ready for web hosting. Deploy the site, ensuring all React components and static assets are properly configured for GitHub Pages. Connect the custom domain purchased from AWS Route 53 to the GitHub Pages site, including DNS configuration and verification of domain ownership. Return all instructions in Markdown as a single response users can follow step-by-step.

## One Shot Prompt OUTPUT
GitHub Pages Site with React & AWS Route 53 Domain

### a. Create React App
1. Ensure that `Node.js` and `npm` are installed on your machine.
2. Run the following command to create a new React app:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-github-pages-site
    cd my-github-pages-site
    ```

3. Customize the React app according to the personas (CIO, VP of Engineering, etc.). Create separate components or sections tailored to each role with content that highlights how the platform reduces the need for experienced engineering talent.

### b. Configure for GitHub Pages
1. Install `gh-pages` package to help with deploying to GitHub Pages:

    ```bash
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

2. Update `package.json` to include GitHub Pages deployment configuration. Add the following fields:

    ```json
    "homepage": "https://<GitHub-username>.github.io/<repository-name>",
    "scripts": {
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
    }
    ```

    Replace `<GitHub-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of your repository.

3. Push your changes to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<GitHub-username>/<repository-name>.git
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main
    ```

## 2. Setup GitHub Repository for GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. In the **Source** section, select the branch `main` and set the folder to `/root`.
4. Save the settings and verify the site URL generated by GitHub Pages.

## 3. Deployment

1. Build and deploy the React app to GitHub Pages:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

2. Verify that the site is live by visiting the URL `https://<GitHub-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

## 4. Connecting Custom Domain (AWS Route 53)

### a. Configure DNS in AWS Route 53
1. In the AWS Route 53 console, navigate to **Hosted Zones** and find the domain purchased.
2. Create two **CNAME** records in the hosted zone for the custom domain:
   - **Name:** `www`
   - **Value:** `<GitHub-username>.github.io`

   - **Name:** `@`
   - **Value:** `<GitHub-username>.github.io`

3. Save the DNS records.

### b. Configure GitHub Pages for Custom Domain
1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages** > **Custom domain**.
3. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`) and click **Save**.
4. GitHub will verify your DNS settings.

### c. Verify Domain Ownership
1. Wait for the DNS propagation, which may take a few minutes.
2. Verify that the GitHub Pages site is accessible via the custom domain by visiting `https://www.yourdomain.com`.

## 5. Final Verification
- Check that the website is live both on the GitHub Pages URL and the custom domain.
- Test navigation and content for each of the targeted personas (CIO, VP of Engineering, etc.) to ensure the site aligns with the value proposition.
