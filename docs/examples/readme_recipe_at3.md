## INPUT/PROMPT
The following prompt was executed recursively (one sub-task at a time) in order to generate the output shown in this file. 

```
GENERATION REQUEST > 
#ROLE :: Evaluator
#CONTEXT :: All units are American. Specify exact quantities and recommend specific varietals that reflect a NorCal/Napa style palette (fresh); recommend Kosher salt, for example, never salt. BE concise! Never overexplain! Explain how to prep and cook, but never more! Recipe book style! Limit to 4 levels of task breakdown. Assume they are already present and gathered.
#CUSTOMER REQUEST :: Make classic chicken pot pie with peas carrots and corn with extra flaky crust
#CURRENT TASK ANCESTRAL CONTEXT :: 
#PRECEDING SIBLING TASK :: -
#CURRENT TASK :: Make classic chicken pot pie with peas carrots and corn with extra flaky crust
#FOLLOWING SIBLING TASK :: -
#CURRENT TASK DEPTH/POSITION :: 1
#ASSIGNMENT :: Determine whether the CURRENT TASK can be executed without confusion as a single transitive task or if it should be broken down into subtasks. Subtasks must be transitive/transformative and assumed to have defined inputs/states and defined outputs/states. RETURN final instructions, not subtasks, if depth > 4 levels. Never overexplain! Anticipate eventual Depth Limit during earlier steps and adjust subtask granularity as needed.
#RESPONSE FORMAT IF SUFFICIENTLY GRANULAR :: { "instructions": "...", "inputs": [{"item": "", "quantity": #, "unit": ""},], "outputs": [{"item": "", "quantity": #, "unit": ""},] }
#RESPONSE FORMAT OTHERWISE :: { "tasks": ["...", "...",] }
```
